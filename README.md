This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. Each year has its own directory, organized to follow best coding practices for the respective programming language used for that year's solutions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
adventofcode/
|- 2024/                        # Year directory
  |- src/                       # Source files for solutions
  |- include/                   # Header files
  |- tests/                     # Unit tests for solutions
  |- Makefile                   # Makefile to build and test solutions
```

## Usage

Navigate to the directory for the specific year to access the solutions and usage instructions.

Each year also contains its own set of unit tests, which are automatically run in GitHub's runner.
