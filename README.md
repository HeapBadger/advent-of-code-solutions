# 🎄 Advent of Code Solutions

![Build Status](https://github.com/HeapBadger/adventofcode/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

This repository contains my solutions to the **Advent of Code** programming challenges — a series of daily puzzles released each December. Each year's solutions are implemented in a consistent, testable format and organized by year.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
adventofcode/
│
├── advent-of-code-2025/
│   ├── ...   
│   └── README.md       # Instructions and notes specific to the year
│
├── advent-of-code-2024/
│   ├── ...   
│   └── README.md       # Instructions and notes specific to the year
│
└── README.md
```

## 🛠️ Usage

Each year is self-contained and has its own build/test system. Navigate to the specific year for instructions.

## 🚀 Continuous Integration

Each directory supports GitHub Actions for CI. Unit tests are automatically executed on push and pull requests to ensure correctness.
